# Spotify-Clone-Website
This code creates a website that is like a clone of the Spotify music-playing app.
Firstly used HTML to define the structure and content of the web page. Used elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, lists, and divs to set up the web page.
Imported icons from fontAwesome in the HTML code.

Then used CSS to style the website and define the visual properties of the HTML using functions like padding, background color, color, font, height, width, margin, etc. Imported fonts from Google Fonts.
It enhances the user experience by creating visually appealing and user-friendly layouts.

Then JavaScript was used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the website. It provides the ability to handle user events like clicks, mouse movements, and keyboard inputs. Here all other play, pause, forward, and backward buttons were defined and the seek bar was updated.

The website was made live and the link to it is- https://ananya05iit.github.io/Spotify-Clone-Website/
